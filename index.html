            In recent years youth related crime has been a very major problem in Australia. So we as a committee have decided to come together to create an initiative to help rehabilitate children who participate in criminal activity, whether that be theft, vandalism or drug use.

            In Australia, the youth crime rate has been decreasing at a steady rate, which is an amazing outcome from committees like ours from our rehabilitation centers.

            Our rehab centers are judgement free rehabilitation programs for kids who have offended to help them re-evaluate their decisions and learn how to become a functioning member of society. To achieve this we offer revolutionary inpatient facilities that has a mix of behavioural education and general curriculum so that your child is still being educated while participating in our program. Not only do we offer a inpatient facilities we also offer outpatient support programs with qualified professionals that come to your house and help to support you and your children through this transition process from a youth offender to a member of society.
